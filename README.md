# Coursera-IBM-capstone

A data visualization project - Part of the IBM applied data science capstone project on the coursera platform.

This is a data analysis project that attempts to use clustering to compare different cities, and see which are more similar.

For the project we will be using: The foursquare API World Cities Database from https://simplemaps.com/data/world-cities containing 15.000 cities The folium geospatial visualization package. (as well as the usual suspects for python; numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit and so forth.)

My code is written in google colab, which is a jupyter notebook. But you can use the same code however you prefer.

The code will attempt the following:

The user will define a starting location(city).
The user will be asked to choose a target country.
The cities will be compared and selected by population.
The comparison will then be based on matching those two user-defined criteria, thus reducing the need for accessing the foursquare API.
